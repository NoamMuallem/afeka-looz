# about
To replace the old and outdated afeka college course pages, 
I created an easy to understand and easy to use app that in the end 
will allow you to download a sorted and easy to read excel file with 
all the data about the chosen courses schedule.
the project is live now on:
https://afeka-looz.herokuapp.com/

# technology
backend (node.js): express api that gets a course id and runs 
a puppeteer script that scrap afeka offitial web pages.

frontends (react in typescript): the frontend using typescript, reat, 
react-router, react-redux and redux-persist, allthow for that spesific 
app it's a bit overkill, it allowed me to learn so match...
